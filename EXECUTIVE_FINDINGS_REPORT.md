# REVENUE DECLINE ANALYSIS 

**Analysis Period:** May 2025 - October 2025
**Report Generated:** October 2025


---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**CRITICAL FINDING:** The company is experiencing a severe revenue and subscriber crisis. Revenue has declined by **24.9%** (from ₹118.8 Lakhs to ₹89.2 Lakhs) over 6 months, with customer base shrinking by **23.4%** (from 110,564 to 84,754 customers).

**Root Cause:** The primary issue is **massive customer churn**, NOT pricing or free customer conversion issues. We are losing paying customers at an alarming rate.

---

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. OVERALL BUSINESS PERFORMANCE

| Metric | May 2025 | October 2025 | Change | % Change |
|--------|----------|--------------|--------|----------|
| **Total Customers** | 110,564 | 84,754 | -25,810 | **-23.4%** |
| **Paid Customers** | 109,896 | 83,926 | -25,970 | **-23.6%** |
| **Free Customers** | 679 | 833 | +154 | +22.7% |
| **Total Revenue** | ₹118.83L | ₹89.21L | -₹29.62L | **-24.9%** |
| **ARPU** | ₹107.48 | ₹105.26 | -₹2.22 | **-2.1%** |

**Key Insight:** ARPU has remained relatively stable (-2.1%), indicating this is NOT a pricing problem. The revenue decline is almost entirely driven by customer loss.

---

### 2. IS IT A SUBSCRIBER BASE PROBLEM?

**YES - This is fundamentally a subscriber retention crisis.**

- We are losing **4,302 customers per month** on average
- Paid customer base declined by **25,970 customers** (23.6%)
- Free customers increased slightly (+154), but represent only **0.98%** of total base
- **The business is hemorrhaging paying customers, not converting them to free**

**This is NOT about free customers - it's about customer churn.**

---

### 3. GEOGRAPHICAL IMPACT - WHICH AREAS ARE AFFECTED MOST?

**ALL CITIES ARE DECLINING - NO EXCEPTIONS**

#### Most Severely Affected Cities (by Revenue Decline %):

| Rank | City | Revenue Decline | Customer Loss | Status |
|------|------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | **Howrah** | **-47.94%** | -41.24% (1,689 customers) | CRITICAL |
| 2 | **Kolkata** | **-28.97%** | -25.86% (7,854 customers) | SEVERE |
| 3 | **Bakrahat** | **-27.80%** | -27.30% (329 customers) | SEVERE |
| 4 | **Chandipur** | **-23.46%** | -22.95% (5,042 customers) | SEVERE |
| 5 | **Bankura** | **-21.66%** | -26.09% (3,269 customers) | SEVERE |
| 6 | **Berhampore** | **-18.14%** | -20.67% (3,018 customers) | HIGH |
| 7 | **Haldia** | **-17.60%** | -18.08% (3,704 customers) | HIGH |
| 8 | **Dinhata** | **-15.85%** | -17.08% (907 customers) | MODERATE |

#### Absolute Impact (Customer & Revenue Loss):

| City | Customers Lost | Revenue Lost | % of Total Loss |
|------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Kolkata** | 7,854 | ₹13.14L | 44.4% |
| **Haldia** | 3,704 | ₹3.45L | 11.6% |
| **Chandipur** | 5,042 | ₹4.37L | 14.7% |
| **Bankura** | 3,269 | ₹2.35L | 7.9% |
| **Berhampore** | 3,018 | ₹2.06L | 7.0% |
| **Howrah** | 1,689 | ₹3.03L | 10.2% |

**Critical Finding:**
- **Kolkata alone accounts for 44.4% of total revenue loss** despite having better ARPU
- **Howrah has the worst decline rate** (-47.94%) with high ARPU erosion
- **No city is performing well** - this is a systemic, company-wide crisis

---

### 4. ARPU ANALYSIS - AREA-WISE PERFORMANCE

#### ARPU by City (May → October 2025):

| City | May ARPU | Oct ARPU | Change | % Change | Category |
|------|----------|----------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Howrah** | ₹154.33 | ₹136.72 | -₹17.61 | **-11.41%** | Highest, Declining |
| **Kolkata** | ₹149.39 | ₹143.14 | -₹6.25 | -4.18% | High, Declining |
| **Bakrahat** | ₹105.12 | ₹104.40 | -₹0.72 | -0.68% | Medium, Stable |
| **Dinhata** | ₹102.50 | ₹104.02 | +₹1.52 | +1.48% | Medium, Growing |
| **Haldia** | ₹95.65 | ₹96.22 | +₹0.57 | +0.60% | Medium-Low, Stable |
| **Bankura** | ₹86.75 | ₹91.95 | +₹5.20 | +5.99% | Low, Growing |
| **Chandipur** | ₹84.73 | ₹84.17 | -₹0.56 | -0.66% | Low, Stable |
| **Berhampore** | ₹77.76 | ₹80.23 | +₹2.47 | +3.18% | Lowest, Growing |

**Key Insights:**

1. **ARPU Disparity is Significant:**
   - Howrah/Kolkata customers pay **nearly 2x more** than Berhampore customers
   - Premium urban markets (Kolkata, Howrah) have higher ARPU but are declining faster
   - Rural/semi-urban markets (Berhampore, Bankura) have lower ARPU but better stability

2. **ARPU Trends:**
   - **High-ARPU cities are losing ARPU** (Howrah -11.41%, Kolkata -4.18%)
   - **Low-ARPU cities are gaining ARPU** (Bankura +5.99%, Berhampore +3.18%)
   - **This suggests we're losing premium customers in urban areas**

3. **Strategic Concern:**
   - Losing high-value customers (Howrah/Kolkata) while retaining/adding low-value customers
   - This creates a "downward spiral" effect on overall revenue

---

### 5. FREE TO PAID CONVERSION ANALYSIS

**FINDING:** Free customer conversion is **NOT** a significant problem.

#### Overall Conversion Metrics:

| Metric | Value | Analysis |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Total Customers** | 130,424 | Across entire 6-month period |
| **Always Paid** | 127,772 (97.97%) | Loyal paying customers |
| **Free to Paid** | 1,483 (1.14%) | Successfully converted |
| **Always Free** | 1,169 (0.90%) | Never converted |
| **Conversion Rate** | 55.92% | Of those who tried free, >50% converted |

#### LCOs with Significant Free Customer Base (>10 free customers):

| Entity Code | City | Always Free | Free to Paid | Conversion Rate | Assessment |
|-------------|------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| **MD0517** | Kolkata | 220 | 0 | 0% | PROBLEM |
| **MDCH189** | Chandipur | 120 | 1 | 0.83% | PROBLEM |
| **MDKH** | Kolkata | 123 | 40 | 24.54% | POOR |
| **MD0430** | Kolkata | 81 | 0 | 0% | PROBLEM |
| **MD0511** | Kolkata | 70 | 0 | 0% | PROBLEM |
| **MD0516** | Howrah | 69 | 0 | 0% | PROBLEM |
| **MSW114** | Berhampore | 64 | 86 | 57.33% | GOOD |
| **MDCH028** | Chandipur | 50 | 42 | 45.65% | MODERATE |

**Key Findings:**

1. **Only 8 LCOs (out of 502) have more than 50 free customers** - this is not systemic
2. **Kolkata has 4 problematic LCOs** with 0% conversion (total 494 free customers)
3. **Total free customers: 1,169** - represents only **0.90%** of customer base
4. **This is NOT driving the revenue decline**

**Conclusion:** While some LCOs (especially in Kolkata) need to improve conversion, free customers are a minor issue compared to the massive paying customer exodus.

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Why is Revenue Declining?

**Primary Cause: Customer Churn (95% of the problem)**
- Losing 4,302 customers per month
- 25,970 paid customers lost in 6 months
- This accounts for 98% of revenue decline

**Secondary Cause: Premium Customer Attrition (5% of the problem)**
- High-ARPU markets (Kolkata, Howrah) losing customers faster
- ARPU erosion in premium markets
- Slight shift toward lower-value customer base

**NOT a Major Factor: Free Customer Issue (<1% of problem)**
- Free customers represent <1% of base
- Conversion rate is reasonable (55.92%)
- Limited revenue impact

---

## CRITICAL AREAS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

### Priority 1: KOLKATA (Immediate Action Required)
- **44.4% of total revenue loss**
- Lost 7,854 customers (-25.86%)
- Revenue down ₹13.14 Lakhs (-28.97%)
- ARPU declining (-4.18%)
- **4 LCOs with zero conversion of free customers (494 free customers total)**
- **Action:** Emergency retention program, investigate service quality, competitor analysis

### Priority 2: HOWRAH (Critical Intervention Needed)
- **Worst decline rate: -47.94% revenue**
- Lost 1,689 customers (-41.24%)
- Highest ARPU (₹154.33) but eroding fast (-11.41%)
- **Action:** Immediate investigation - service disruption? Competitor entry? Pricing issues?

### Priority 3: CHANDIPUR & HALDIA (High Priority)
- Combined loss of 8,746 customers
- Combined revenue loss of ₹7.82 Lakhs (26.3% of total)
- **Action:** Regional retention strategy, competitive positioning

---

## STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

### 1. This is NOT a Growth Problem - It's a Retention Crisis
- We don't need more new customers; we need to stop losing existing ones
- Every retention initiative has 10x ROI compared to acquisition

### 2. Urban Markets in Severe Distress
- Kolkata and Howrah account for 54.6% of revenue loss
- Premium customers are leaving - competitor threat or service quality issues?
- Need immediate competitive intelligence in urban markets

### 3. Free Customer Conversion is a Distraction
- Only 1,169 always-free customers across entire network
- Focus on the 25,970 paying customers we LOST, not the 1,169 free ones we couldn't convert

### 4. ARPU Management Critical
- Losing high-ARPU customers while retaining low-ARPU ones
- This creates a structural revenue problem beyond just headcount
- Need to protect premium customer base

---

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Immediate (Next 30 Days):

1. **Kolkata Emergency Response:**
   - Task force to investigate Kolkata customer exodus
   - Exit interviews with churned customers (sample of 100)
   - Competitive service and pricing audit
   - Identify and fix service quality issues
   - Target 4 problematic LCOs for free customer conversion (MD0517, MD0430, MD0511, MD0516)

2. **Howrah Crisis Management:**
   - On-ground investigation of -47.94% revenue collapse
   - Check for network outages, service disruptions, or competitor activity
   - Emergency retention offers for remaining high-value customers

3. **Retention Program Launch:**
   - Proactive outreach to at-risk customers (usage pattern analysis)
   - Win-back campaign for recently churned customers (within 60 days)
   - Loyalty rewards for long-tenure customers

### Short Term (90 Days):

4. **Service Quality Audit:**
   - Network quality assessment in all declining cities
   - Customer satisfaction surveys (NPS tracking)
   - Fix identified technical/service issues

5. **Competitive Response:**
   - Market intelligence on competitor pricing, offers, and service quality
   - Develop competitive response strategy for urban markets
   - Consider tactical pricing adjustments in high-churn areas

6. **LCO Performance Management:**
   - Identify and support underperforming LCOs
   - Share best practices from stable LCOs (Dinhata, Bankura showing better trends)
   - Monthly LCO scorecards with churn metrics

### Long Term (6-12 Months):

7. **Business Model Review:**
   - Assess sustainability of operations in severely declining cities
   - Consider market repositioning or strategic partnerships
   - Evaluate infrastructure investment needs

8. **Customer Value Management:**
   - Segment customers by value (ARPU tiers)
   - Differentiated retention strategies by segment
   - Protect high-ARPU customers with premium service levels

---

## CONCLUSION

**The company faces an existential customer retention crisis, not a conversion or pricing problem.**

- **25,970 paying customers lost** in 6 months is catastrophic
- **Kolkata and Howrah** are bleeding high-value customers
- **All cities declining** suggests systemic issues (service quality, competition, or market dynamics)
- **Free customer conversion is irrelevant** when losing 4,300+ paying customers monthly

**Without immediate intervention, we project:**
- Customer base: ~68,000 by March 2026 (-38% from May 2025)
- Monthly revenue: ~₹72 Lakhs by March 2026 (-39% from May 2025)
- Potential business viability concerns by Q3 2026

**Immediate executive action required to stop the hemorrhaging.**
