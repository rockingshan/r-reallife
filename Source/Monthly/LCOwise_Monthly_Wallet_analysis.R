# === Step 1: Load Data ===
# Replace with actual file paths
may_file <- file.choose()
june_file <- file.choose()

may <- read_csv(may_file, show_col_types = FALSE)

# === Step 2: Filter for INVOICE document type ===
may <- may %>%
  filter(`Credit Document Type` == "INVOICE") %>%
  mutate(Month = "May")

june <- june %>%
  filter(`Credit Document Type` == "INVOICE") %>%
  mutate(Month = "June")

# === Step 3: Combine and Clean ===

# === Step 4: Entity-Level Summary ===

# === Step 5: Entity + Plan Summary ===
entity_plan_summary <- combined %>%

# === Step 6: Save Outputs ===
